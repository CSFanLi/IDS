<br/>
This repository contains the code for the project "Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning". The code and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be used in anomaly-based cyber attack detection application.<br/>
</br>
It proposed intrusion detection system by implementing many machine learning algorithms including random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost,etc.<br/>
## Abstract
## Dataset
CICIDS2017 dataset provided by Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity(CIC) and University of New Brunswick(UNB) contains benign and the most up-to-date common attacks, which resembles the true real-world data. https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html<br/>
<br/>
The CICIDS2017 dataset consists of labeled network flows, including full packet payloads in pcap format, the corresponding profiles and the labeled flows (GeneratedLabelledFlows.zip) and CSV files for machine and deep learning purpose (MachineLearningCSV.zip) are publicly available for researchers.<br/>
