This repository contains the code for the project "Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning". The code and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be used in anomaly-based cyber attack detection application.
It proposed intrusion detection system by implementing many machine learning algorithms including random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost,etc.
